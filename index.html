        <p>Maggi is liquid gold. Maggi is curry-flavored magic, my childhood in a bowl. Maggi is perfect when soupy,
            perfect sans broth, perfect even straight out of the fridge. What Maggi is is this ‚Äî a brick of instant
            noodles that you crack in half over boiling water, then cook with a flavored powder that looks like
            straight-up turmeric and tastes like 2,000 percent of your daily recommended sodium intake. Maggi 2-Minute
            Noodle is a phenomenon: In 2014, according to Fortune, Indians consumed 400,000 tons of it.

            Maggi originated in Switzerland, was later acquired by the Swiss-owned Nestl√©, and began import to India in
            1983, just 36 years after the country became independent from colonial British rule. By the early 2000s,
            Maggi had found a frantic, loyal consumer base in metropolitan India. It‚Äôs unclear what Maggi‚Äôs curry flavor
            is supposed to represent, since no Indian curry I‚Äôve ever tasted bears a passing resemblance: I have to
            assume it must be that European-adjacent brand of nuclear yellow curry, heavy on nondescript ‚Äúcurry powder‚Äù
            and low on any depth of flavor. But Maggi‚Äôs appeal lies in its potential for customization ‚Äî no one I know
            eats Maggi as-is. My friends make it with fried garlic, red chile powder sprinkled on top. My mom cooks hers
            with cut-up hot dogs. As a kid, I liked mine with peanuts, doused in ketchup. These doctored dishes are now
            an indelible memory for a generation of consumers, nostalgia wielded as a powerful marketing tool.

            But in 2015, Maggi was also at the center of a massive food safety scandal, during which the noodles
            allegedly tested positive for high lead content, and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India issued
            a brief, nationwide ban on all Maggi products. Nestl√© India has long maintained the product is safe, and
            that its own testing at the time ‚Äúconsistently show[ed] levels in Maggi Noodles to be within permissible
            limits.‚Äù And despite the negative press, Maggi retains a devoted fan base.

            During the ban, customers would ask if Hungry Head was somehow still serving the noodles, Prohibition-style.
            From Delhi to Mumbai, outside train stations and office buildings, street vendors dish up ladlefuls of Maggi
            swimming in curry broth. Up from the northeastern state of Sikkim and all the way down to Pune, college
            students and young professionals congregate at cafes for chai and noodles made-to-order, with crispy onions,
            bright red chile pepper sauce, or a whole fried egg. Butter chicken Maggi, tandoori Maggi, and paneer chile
            Maggi are all common offerings, the noodles fortified with meat, vegetables, and spices drawn from Indian
            and Indo-Chinese cooking.
